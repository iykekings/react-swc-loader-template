## A react starter template using swc-loader with Typescript support ðŸ˜‹

### What to expect

- Fast build time cos of [swc](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) "...a super-fast js/ts compiler written in rust"

- Typescript support - Oh from swc too

- .swcrc for configuring swc - think babelrc

- No babel of course
